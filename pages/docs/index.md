There are three different ways to grant employees access to accounts. You can grant them default access to all accounts, assign them to only selected accounts, or assign them to accounts at specific job stages by using our pipeline automations.

Covered here:

*   [Account access](#10)
*   [Default account access](#8)
*   [Giving an employee access to one account](#1)
*   [Giving an employee access to multiple accounts](#6)
*   [Giving an employee access to all accounts](#11)
*   [Giving employees account access via pipeline automation](#9)
*   [Requesting/granting access for the account](#12)
*   [Viewing an employee’s accounts](#2)
*   [Viewing employee account stats](#4)
*   [Removing employee access from an account](#5)
*   [Who can grant employee access to an account](#7)

Account access
--------------

At least one team member should have access to all accounts. When they do, they can view and edit any client’s info, upload documents and create invoices. They also receive notifications about all account activity.

![tip](https://taxdome-public.s3.amazonaws.com/images/notification/note.png)

Note: Team members may be assigned to accounts without receiving notifications. Here's more on [Account Followers](https://help.taxdome.com/article/401-account-followers).

By default, once an employee has client account access, they can do all these:

*   View the account info
*   View and download client docs
*   View all chat threads for their assigned accounts and respond to them
*   View all of the firm's emails for their assigned accounts and respond to them
*   View all of the firm’s notes for their assigned accounts and create new ones
*   View the firm’s time entries for their assigned accounts and create new time entries
*   View all of the firm’s tasks for their assigned accounts
*   Create tasks for assigned accounts
*   View contacts that are linked to their assigned accounts

To get a sense of what an employee can do, visit a [read-only view of their portal](https://help.taxdome.com/article/221-access-the-read-only-view-of-client-account).

Default account access
----------------------

A firm owner has default account access. However, a firm owner or admin may also want to give one or several team members automatic access to all new accounts created [manually](https://help.taxdome.com/article/100-adding-accounts) or to clients who [register on their own](https://help.taxdome.com/article/235-the-portal-sign-up-link-how-to-customize-remove-and-use-it).

To set up default account access for a team member:

Go to **Settings**, then open the **Firm Settings** tab. Find the **Default Account Access** section, select one or more team members from the list, then click **SAVE**.

Giving an employee access to one account
----------------------------------------

There are several ways to go about giving an employee account access:

*   By setting them up with [default account access](#8)
*   While creating a new account
*   By editing an existing account at any point
*   [By using the manage team access feature](https://help.taxdome.com/article/44-assigning-removing-team-members-to-a-client#6) at any point
*   [By using a pipeline automation](#9)

To give an employee access to a new account, select their name while creating the account manually or while [importing client data](https://help.taxdome.com/article/122-import).

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5be60d8f04286304a71c1d53/images/62842b9fc01fce37d9b14265/file-ByzjG38geJ.gif)

To give an employee access to an existing account:

1\. Go to **Clients**, then click on the client’s name in the list. You can also instantly find the client by going to the left sidebar menu on any page and entering their name in the search field.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5be60d8f04286304a71c1d53/images/5fe485d7f24ccf588e3fe68c/file-7tQZ43sIqG.gif)

2\. Go to the **Info** section and click on the **Edit** link to the right of **Account details**. Add employees you want to give account access to in the **Team members** field. Each account needs to have at least one team member assigned to it. By default, account access is given to the firm owner. 

3\. Click on the **Continue** button and then click **Save**.

Giving an employee access to multiple accounts
----------------------------------------------

To assign employees to lots of different accounts at one time:

1\. Go to **Clients**, then select the checkboxes next to the accounts you want to assign to employees. To select all accounts, click the uppermost checkbox.

2\. Click **Manage** **Team**.

3\. You’ll see a list of the firm’s team members. For each team member, select one of the following:

*   **Do nothing****:** The team member won’t be assigned to the accounts; however, if the team member is already assigned to accounts, they will continue to be assigned to those accounts.
*   **Assign to all****:** The team member will be assigned to all selected accounts.
*   **Remove from all****:** The team member will no longer be assigned to any of the selected accounts.

4\. Click **ASSIGN**.

Giving an employee access to all accounts
-----------------------------------------

To assign an employee to all accounts:

1\. Go to **Settings**, select **T****eam & Plans** in the menu bar, navigate to **Active Team Members,** then click on the employee’s name.

2\. Click on the **Edit** **Access Rights** pencil icon, then toggle on **View all accounts**.

3\. Click **Save**. Now the employee will be able to view all of the firm’s accounts instead of just the ones they've been assigned.

Giving employees account access via pipeline automation
-------------------------------------------------------

For temporary staff, you may choose to grant limited access to accounts. For example, a temporary employee might need to access a document uploaded to an account, but only during a specific stage of the work process.

This can be easily set up and automated inside a pipeline. Here’s how:

1\. Decide at what stage you need the temporary worker to access client accounts. (You can read more about [automations](https://help.taxdome.com/article/108-using-automations).)

2\. Go to the [pipeline settings](https://help.taxdome.com/article/106-using-pipelines#7), choose the stage to which you would like to add the automation, click on the **Add automations** link, then choose **Update account access** in the pull-down menu. Choose the team member(s) from the account list.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5be60d8f04286304a71c1d53/images/63d1259a1f7c4c45e9fbb1fa/file-RZYUlEOKKI.png)

The automation can be configured in different ways:

*   **Replace Assignees to Default Users** on + **Add Account Access** empty:  
    When a job enters this stage, assigned employees become unassigned, and ones with **Default** **Account Access** are assigned to the account instead.
*   **Replace Assignees to Default Users** on + **Add Account Access** filled:  
    When a job enters this stage, assigned employees become unassigned, and ones listed in the **Add Account Access** field are assigned to the account instead.
*   **Replace Assignees to Default Users** off + **Add Account Access** field filled:  
    When a job enters this stage, assigned employees remain assigned to the account, and the ones listed in the **Add Account Access** field are assigned as well.
*   **Replace Assignees to Default Users** off + **Remove Account Access** filled:  
    When a job enters this stage, employees listed in the **Remove Account Access** field become unassigned.
*   **Add Account Access** filled + **Remove Account Access** filled:  
    When a job enters this stage, employees listed in the **Add Account Access** field are assigned to the account, and ones listed in the **Remove Account Access** are unassigned.

Requesting/Granting Access for the Account
------------------------------------------

If a firm employee without access to the client account clicks on any page within the client profile, they'll see a 401 error. This could happen:

*   If a team member mentions an employee in a chat thread with a client to whose account the employee doesn't have access
*   If a team member mentions an employee in a job for a client to whose account the employee doesn't have access or in a job that is located inside the pipeline that is not available to the employee

To request access to a client account and/or to the pipeline, an employee needs to click **Request access** either in the Inbox+ notification or on the error page.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5be60d8f04286304a71c1d53/images/63da6f26d4571976c49ddfb9/file-hNVhd617nB.png)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5be60d8f04286304a71c1d53/images/62e8f289fd22194ce53a6740/file-zRwFGU0SBi.png)

Firm owner and employees with permission to [assign teammates](#7) will be notified via **Inbox+**. Once they click on a **Grant Access** link in the **Inbox+** notification, the employee will be given access.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5be60d8f04286304a71c1d53/images/63654eb2be6f3025a9d0d5e8/file-NaaMOeM6Zv.jpg)

Viewing an employee’s accounts
------------------------------

Filter your account list to see which client accounts are assigned to specific employees:

1\. Go to **Clients**, then click **Filter** in the top right.

2\. Select the team members in the **Team** section, then click **Apply**.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5be60d8f04286304a71c1d53/images/62eb5b2926aa5532ebc0c033/file-A7s5EpD95H.gif)

Viewing employee account stats
------------------------------

Firm owner and admins can view any employee’s stats for their assigned accounts. These stats can be found in the **Pending client activity** widget on the **Insights** page. 

This widget displays **invoices**, **organizers**, **signatures**, **contracts** and **approvals** awaiting action from the client for a specific employee. 

If you want to track client activity for two or more team members, you can add as many **Pending client activity** widgets as you need. Here's more about the [**Pending client activity** widget](https://help.taxdome.com/article/858-your-dashboard-firm-insights#5).

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5be60d8f04286304a71c1d53/images/639978ffefdd5760d1d80be6/file-Tc6EtAZVw5.png)

Another way to view account stats is the **Employee's Current Clients** page. To find it, go to **Settings**, then to **Team & Plan**. Click on the employee name, then go to the **Clients** tab. Stats are available for that employee's current and past accounts.

You’ll see this info:

*   **ID:** the account’s unique ID
*   **Name:** the client’s first and last name
*   **Assigned:** the date the employee was assigned to an account
*   **Invoices posted:** the number of invoices posted
*   **Revenue:** the total amount for the invoices paid
*   **Docs uploaded:** the number of documents uploaded
*   **Approved:** the number of documents approved

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5be60d8f04286304a71c1d53/images/62eb5cec26aa5532ebc0c037/file-WCIJOqr5Vf.png)

Removing employee access to an account
--------------------------------------

Say you have a personal account in your firm and don't want other team members to see it. Or you have some changes in the roles and duties of your employees and don't want all of them to have access to all accounts.

You can [remove employees from any client account](#revoke1). (Or you can do it the other way around: [remove accounts from an employee's list of assigned clients](#revoke2).) Please check out the options below.

![tip](https://taxdome-public.s3.amazonaws.com/images/notification/attention.png)

Warning: If you have employees with **View all accounts** access right turned on, you'll first need to [toggle off that access right](#11). However, this doesn't work for your [admins](https://help.taxdome.com/article/601-team-basic-owner-admin-employee-roles#2), as they always have access to all accounts.

**To remove employees from a client account:**

1.  Go to the **Info** section of the client's profile and click on the **Edit** link to the right from **Account details.** All employees with account access are displayed in the **Team members** field.
2.  Click on **×** to the right from a team member to remove their access to a client account.
3.  Click on the **Continue** button and then click **Save.**

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5be60d8f04286304a71c1d53/images/63cfaba3627fa96d94940293/file-ATMqaMoHpY.gif)

![tip](https://taxdome-public.s3.amazonaws.com/images/notification/note.png)

Note! An account can’t be unassigned. If you remove all employees, the account becomes automatically assigned to anyone with [default account access](https://help.taxdome.com/article/194-assigning-removing-team-members-to-a-client-account#8).

You can also **remove an account from an employee’s list of assigned clients**:

1.  Go to **Settings**, then to **Team & Plans**, then click on the team member’s name and go to the **Clients** tab.
2.  Click on the red delete symbol to the far right of the account name.
3.  Click **Delete** in the **Delete Confirmation** pop-up. The selected account is then moved to the employee’s **Past** tab.

Who can grant employee access to accounts
-----------------------------------------

Firm owner and admins can always give employees access rights to accounts. They also can give employees the ability to assign clients to team members. If you’re a firm owner or admin and want someone else on the team to assign accounts, follow these steps:

1\. Go to **Settings**, select **Team & Plans** in the menu bar, navigate to **Active Team Members**, then click on the employee name.

2\. Click on the **Edit Access Rights** pencil icon, then turn on **Assign teammates** toggle.

3\. Click **Save**.
